------------------------------
Tested on
------------------------------
Ubuntu 10.04 32 bit
Ubuntu 10.10 32 and 64 bit
Ubuntu 10.10 32 and 64 bit as VMware virtual machine guest (OSX Lion 64 bit host)
Ubuntu 11.10 32 and 64 bit
Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit as VMware virtual machine guest (Win7 64 bit host)


------------------------------
BUILDING openpliPC
------------------------------

1a) download openpliPC git repo as local user (not root):
git clone https://github.com/nobody9/openpliPC.git
cd openpliPC/

 - OR -

1b) Keep in sync previously cloned git repo:
cd openpliPC/
git pull https://github.com/nobody9/openpliPC.git


2) Building needed openpliPC enigma2 libraries:
It download, build and install all needed libraries
Some tasks require root access (sudo). You will be asked for your password.
This task must be run ONCE at the first time. These libs are compiled from
its original sources and aren't patched anyway.

./build_libs.sh
If you are interested to have a logfile , simply do:
./build_libs.sh 2>&1 | tee build_libs.log



3) Build Xine-lib and openpliPC Enigma2:
It compile and install xine-lib and the openpliPC Enigma2.
xine-lib and enigma2 are included in openpliPC main repo and code
is already patched ready to compile.
Some tasks require root access (sudo). You will be asked for your password.

./build_openpliPC.sh 
If you are interested to have a logfile , simply do:
./build_openpliPC.sh.sh 2>&1 | tee build_log.log

./build_openpliPC.sh has two command-line options:
./build_openpliPC.sh -b     backup E2 config before new E2 build&install
./build_openpliPC.sh -r     restore E2 config after new E2 build&install (previously saved with -b)
./build_openpliPC.sh -b -r  backup config, build&install E2, restore old config


------------------------------
Where is Enigma2 ?
------------------------------

Enigma2 will be installed in /usr/local/e2/ (see build_openpliPC.sh $INSTALL_E2DIR )
Example configs in /usr/local/e2/etc/enigma2/
The hole /proc/stb directory are located at /usr/local/e2/etc/stb/


------------------------------
Run enigma2
------------------------------

Enigma2 requires to be launched as root user:
sudo /usr/local/e2/bin/enigma2

If you are inside openpliPC/ simply do:
sudo ./e2bin

If you are concerned about security, build and run Enigma2 in a Virtual Machine


------------------------------
Informations
------------------------------

1)
with xine_vdpau I get osd, video (SD and HD) and sound,
with xine_xshm I get video (SD and HD) and sound ,
with xine_sdl I get only video (SD and HD) in size 720x576 they donÂ´t scale and sound.

VDPAU has the best results but it's only available with Nvidia graphics cards
VDPAU library use Nvidia GPU as MPEG2/4 hardware coprocessor speeding up decode process

2)
Some remote control keys are remapped to local PC keyboard

RED     ->  F1
GREEN   ->  F2
YELLOW  ->  F3
BLUE    ->  F4

VOL UP    ->  +  (numeric pad)
VOL DOWN  ->  -  (numeric pad)

NEXT CHANN. -> ARROW DOWN
PREV CHANN. -> ARROW UP
NEXT BOUQUET -> PAGE DOWN
PREV BOUQUET -> PAGE UP

EXIT    ->  ESC
MENU    ->  SPACE
INFO    ->  I or F5
OK      ->  ENTER

EPG     ->  E or F6
POWER   ->  F10
RECORD  ->  R
TV      ->  T
VIDEO   ->  V
AUDIO   ->  A
MUTE    ->  M
TIMESHIFT ->  P

QUIT ENIGMA2      ->  X
FULL SCREEN MODE  ->  F11


3)
Default NIM is configured in /usr/local/e2/etc/tuxbox/nim_sockets
NIM Socket 0:
            Type: DVB-S2
            Name: VTUNER
            Has_Outputs: no
            Frontend_Device: 0

If you want to change or add NIM, you must edit nim_sockets file.
Example: to change from DVB-S2 to DVB-T NIM, change "Type" as below
NIM Socket 0:
            Type: DVB-T
            Name: VTUNER
            Has_Outputs: no
            Frontend_Device: 0


4)
Adding systemplugins, extensions or skins 
put systemplugins in /usr/local/e2/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/SystemPlugins
put extensions in /usr/local/e2/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions
put skin in /usr/local/e2/share/enigma2


5)
In order to record a movie you must create the /hdd/movies directory or use a symbolic link
i.e. 
sudo ln -s /my/movie/archive /hdd
sudo mkdir /hdd/movies


6)
/usr/local/e2/share/enigma2/xine.conf has many options about video and audio control
take a look into it


7)
Using vtuner http://code.google.com/p/vtuner/ user can share his tuner over network connection.
It's a client/server software. Server must be installed where you have a tuner (i.e. your STB like CT9x00 , DM800 ..) 
and client must be installed where you have not the physical tuner (i.e. PC)
Example ( http://openpli.org/forums/topic/20871-build-script-for-openpli-enigma2-on-ubuntu-104-32-bit/page__view__findpost__p__238841 )
  kill enigma with init 4, kill your running cardemu
  vtunerd 1 01 2 0 & on the dm8000
  start your emu and then start enigma with init 3
  modprobe vtunerc on the i686
  vtunerc -f s2 &
  start openplipc

Cougar for porting Enigma2 to Enigma2PC.
kanber_kav  implement a Mediaplayer in Enigma2PC over xinelib without gstreamer and implement subtitles.
buyukbang  for testing.
ambrosa  for testing, cosmethic changes of the scripts, docs.
